## TPCC
- TPCC can be used for portraying the activity of a wholesale supplier.
Suppose there is a wholesale supplier with a number of geographically distributed sale districts and associated warehouses. As company expand, new warehouse and associated sales districts are created. Hence there are various types defined to represent the wholesale supplier. 
- New order transaction:
It inserts a new order record. As we had defined new order as a record type, so inserting a new order inserts the record.
